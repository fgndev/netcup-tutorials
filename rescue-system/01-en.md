# Introduction
This tutorial describes how to install and boot a dedicated rescue system independent of your server's main operating system.

The rescue system is useful to fix the main operating system if it is in an 
FIXME: advantages over 'recovery mode' of debian ?
 - cross-platform, works with every Linux OS
 - separate system which does not rely on the host OS
 - full-blown system with dedicated tools meant for the rescue
 - in-memory, does not touch actual hard disk and hence allows us to change partition table, too!

This is useful, for example, when traveling or if internet access is limited in hotels or vacation homes.

The reading time of this tutorial is about five minutes; implementation will take approximately 45 minutes.

You should be comfortable with the Linux Command Line and the Linux Boot Process in general.
The most important requirement for implementation is a basic understanding of the Unix command line and the use of SSH services and proxy servers. All examples were tested on a current Debian/Ubuntu (October 2021) and can be easily adapted to other distributions.

The tutorial uses the example hostname `v11111111.quicksrv.de`. This hostname needs to be replaced by the name of your own server when you perform the workflow described in this tutorial.

# Requirements

- 1GB of RAM
- 1GB of free disk space

FIXME: we have but one requirement: sufficient RAM, we need 1GB (check that with the oracle cloud stuff)
```bash
root@build-instance:~# free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           952Mi       162Mi       286Mi       0.0Ki       502Mi       621Mi
Swap:          4.0Gi        53Mi       3.9Gi
root@build-instance:~#
```

Since the presented technology is optimized for short deployment times ranging from days to a few weeks, the server should meet the following requirements:

* It should be economical,
* have sufficient CPU power, and
* it should have a German IP address.

The hard disk capacity, on the other hand, is not relevant.

The simplest VPS from netcup meets these requirements thanks to hourly billing.

# Step 1 - Retrieving the rescue system

1. Download the ISO image
2. Validate the ISO image via the checksum
3. Loop-mount the ISO-Image to check the filesystem

## 1. Download the ISO-image
The rescue system is provided as an ISO image, a filesystem type that is meant to be burnt to a CD ROM. You can actually
create a rescue CD using this file, but we will use it as a read-only filesystem.

At the time of the creation of this tutorial (October 2023), the recommended product to be used is [System Rescue 10.02](https://sourceforge.net/projects/systemrescuecd/files/sysresccd-x86/10.02/systemrescue-10.02-amd64.iso/download).
To install the rescue system, download the ISO-Image using either wget or curl:
```bash
# Download using wget
root@build-instance:~# wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/systemrescuecd/files/sysresccd-x86/10.02/systemrescue-10.02-amd64.iso/download -O /root/rescue.iso

# Download using curl
root@build-instance:~# curl -L https://sourceforge.net/projects/systemrescuecd/files/sysresccd-x86/10.02/systemrescue-10.02-amd64.iso/download -o /root/rescue.iso
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  1053    0  1053    0     0   4020      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  4034
100   405  100   405    0     0    611      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   611
100  763M  100  763M    0     0  14.1M      0  0:00:54  0:00:54 --:--:-- 10.5M
root@build-instance:~#
```
Technically you can put the file anywhere you want, but the recommendation is to put it into the /root folder and that is what we assume for the next part, too.
We also name it 'rescue.iso' because this way all it takes to update to the latest version is to repeat steps 1 and 2 of this tutorial, we don't have to touch
GRUB config again.
Why /root ? So people can't manipulate the file easily

## 2. Validate the ISO image 
Verify your ISO image by validating the [checksum](https://www.system-rescue.org/releases/10.02/systemrescue-10.02-amd64.iso.sha256) which is provided
on the SystemRescue site. Again you can use either curl or wget to retrieve the URL.
```
# Using curl
# root@build-instance:~# curl https://www.system-rescue.org/releases/10.02/systemrescue-10.02-amd64.iso.sha256
# Using wget
root@build-instance:~# wget -qO- https://www.system-rescue.org/releases/10.02/systemrescue-10.02-amd64.iso.sha256
d7d0af245c6e1e4360136e0ad378ede56a9f1285db4454c6055092dfc2c63d67 *systemrescue-10.02-amd64.iso
root@build-instance:~# sha256sum systemrescue.iso
d7d0af245c6e1e4360136e0ad378ede56a9f1285db4454c6055092dfc2c63d67  systemrescue.iso
root@build-instance:~#
```
Make sure that the checksums are identical.

## 3. Loop-mount the ISO image
Now that we have verified the integrity of the downloaded file, we make sure that we are really looking at a filesystem and loop-mount the
filesystem.
```
root@build-instance:~# losetup --show -f systemrescue.iso
/dev/loop7
root@build-instance:~# mount /dev/loop7 /mnt/
mount: /mnt: WARNING: source write-protected, mounted read-only.
root@build-instance:~#
```
The above warning is perfectly normal as this is a read-only filesystem (remember, we are actually looking at a CD-ROM filesystem).
Take a look at the filesystem using the ''ls'' command and if it looks like the below we are now confident that we can proceed to
the next step. 
```
root@build-instance:~# ls -l /mnt/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2048 Sep 16 19:19 EFI
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2048 Sep 16 19:29 autorun
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2048 Sep 16 19:19 boot
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2048 Sep 16 19:19 isolinux
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2048 Sep 16 19:29 sysresccd
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2048 Sep 16 19:29 sysrescue.d
root@build-instance:~#
```
Don't forget to umount the image and remove the loop device:
```
root@build-instance:~# umount /mnt
root@build-instance:~# losetup -d /dev/loop7
root@build-instance:~#
```

# Step 2 - Adding a GRUB boot menu entry
Once you have successfully downloaded the rescue system, a boot menu entry has to be added to the GRUB bootloader's config.

1. Edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom1
2. Update GRUB config using ?

## Edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom1
First, we'll have to determine the filesystem UUID of the device you are booting from so that the bootloader knows where
to search for the ISO image we want it to boot from.
```
eval $(findmnt -P /) && eval blkid -o export $SOURCE
DEVNAME=/dev/sda1
LABEL=cloudimg-rootfs
UUID=14bac670-df63-4b40-9865-2fd2a02b4de3
BLOCK_SIZE=4096
TYPE=ext4
PARTUUID=ced2f978-13f6-4c44-949a-8cbe4e9842f1
```
The output should look something like the above and we are (obviously) interested in the line that starts with UUID.

How to find the filesystem lablel:
```
root@build-instance:/etc/grub.d# eval $(findmnt -P /) && lsblk -o +label $SOURCE
NAME MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS LABEL
sda1   8:1    0 46.5G  0 part /           cloudimg-rootfs
root@build-instance:/etc/grub.d#
```
This is what the output might look like, and we want the value in the LABEL column, in this case it is 'cloudimg-rootfs'

Here you can find the official documentation of available [boot options][https://www.system-rescue.org/manual/Booting_SystemRescue/] on
the System-Rescue homepage.

FIXME: here we must enter the actual /etc/grub.d/40_custom file content, pointing out where we've put the UUID and the LABEL

FIXME: backup, then update boot config
```
Then we backup /boot/grub/grub.cfg and run grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

# Step 3 - Testing the Rescue System via the serial console
SSH daemon usually listens on port 22. To make it accessible even from restricted networks, it is configured to listen also on ports 443 (HTTPS) and 80 (HTTP). These ports are usually less restricted or not restricted at all, so there is a good chance that they can be used to gain free access to the proxy and thus to the internet.

1. Open the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` in an editor like `vi` or `nano`.
2. Search for the line `port 22`. It probably starts with a `#` to indicate that this is the basic configuration.
3. Change the file to:
   ```
   port 22 
   port 80 
   port 443 
   ```
4. Save and exit the editor.
5. Restart SSH daemon with `systemctl restart ssh`. The current session should remain active.
6. Use `ssh -p 443 root@v11111111.quicksrv.de` to test if the configuration was set up successfully.
   Please replace `v11111111.quicksrv.de` with your own hostname.

SSH daemon is now successfully configured and can be reached via ports 22, 80 and 443.

# Step 4 - Example 1, resize the root partition

![The SOCKS proxy can handle multiple ports simultaneously](community-tutorials/setup-and-use-sshproxy/images/socks.png)

# Step 5 - Example 2, run aide to create checksums of your root filesystem

![The jump host will forward a connection](community-tutorials/setup-and-use-sshproxy/images/jump.png)

# Conclusion

Where to go from here ? Well, now we can harden our system and e.g. install a custom Linux kernel so we can take
advantage of current kernels
